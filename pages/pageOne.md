# Initial idea 
		The goal of this project is to create a 3D Game using Unity for my final year project which features other technologies integrated into the project.
		The game will be a first person shooter (FPS) game that will be themed towards pirates in the 16th century. The game will feature crafting and leveling up system along with NPC characters and a dialog system. A database system will also store Players login information and progress in the game.
# Game Concept
The player is marooned on an island after a storm ran the ship aground. The player escaped being a prisoner on the ship and now has to survive on the island. The player will have to complete quests, solve problems interact with Non Player Characters (NPC) to recieve information and progress further on the island. The overall goal of the game is for the player to increase in level and collect key pickups to build a ship and leave the island.
